This is the quick tutorial that teach how to deploy your own Notion blog using Buroguru.


## Step 1: Setting up database


Before deploying Buroguru, you'll need to prepare a Notion database to serve as your blog’s content source. You can either clone the [template](/21ad51c831448068b621f3b5def5dd2d) or create your own with following fields.


| Field Name    | Type          | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Title`       | Title         | The title of the post.                                                                      |
| `id`          | Text          | The id of the post, also the url-slug of the blog. (e.g. `buruguru.zudo.cc/get-started-en`. |
| `Published`   | Checkbox      | Whether to publish.                                                                         |
| `Tags`        | Multi-select  | Category tags                                                                               |
| `Date`        | Date          | Just date that indicate the time your wrote the post.                                       |
| `Description` | Text          | Brief summary of the posts shown in preview.                                                |
| `Thumbnail`   | Files & media | Thumbnail image.                                                                            |


## Step 2: Setting up Notion Integration


To allow Buroguru to access your Notion database, you need to create a Notion Integration and get the access token.

1. Create new integration

	Go to [Notion Integration](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) and click ‘Add Integration’, select the workspace where your database is located, and give your integration a name like ‘blog’, the logo is not required.

2. Update the capabilities

	Click the new added integration, In the **Content Capabilities** section, at least toggle **Read content.**


	![image.png](/images/posts/80f59dd9-c891-471a-8714-66648f2376dd.png)

3. Copy Notion token

	After creating it, you’ll see a field labeled **`Internal Integration Token`**. Copy this token, we’ll use it later.

4. Add connection

	Go back to the Notion database you create earlier in “full page”, click the three dots in the top right, then on the bottom, click **Connections** and select the integration just added.

5. Copy database id

	Click **Share** button on the top right, and click **Copy Link,** and you’ll get a link like [`https://www.notion.so/wusandwitch-notes/212d51c8314480ca8d4ffa62487XXXXXX?v=212d51c8314480a89fea000cXXXXXX&source=copy_link`](https://www.notion.so/wusandwitch-notes/212d51c8314480ca8d4ffa624873e734?v=212d51c8314480a89fea000c43f4e73f) .


	![image.png](/images/posts/4a2909cd-f6dd-410e-a2cf-4e6b2c093e2b.png)


	And the `Database ID` will be the first id (the one before `?`), the one in the example will be  [`212d51c8314480ca8d4ffa62487XXXXXX`](https://www.notion.so/wusandwitch-notes/212d51c8314480ca8d4ffa624873e734?v=212d51c8314480a89fea000c43f4e73f)```, and keep it, we'll also use it later.


## Step 3: Setting up repository and token


Once the Notion integration is ready, you can fork the Buroguru repository to your GitHub account and deploy your blog to Vercel in just a few clicks.

1. Fork the repository

	Go to [https://github.com/WuSandWitch/Buroguru](https://github.com/WuSandWitch/Buroguru) and click **Fork.**


	![image.png](/images/posts/1f123e9c-3823-447c-9264-74d3821e99a7.png)


	Give the repository you like, like `WuSandWitch-Blog`

2. Configure Github Secrets /  Notion token

	After clone, go to **Setting**, and then **Secrets and variables**, go to **Action,** and add the “Repository Secrets”, by clicking **New repository secret.**

	![image.png](/images/posts/fcf265d5-b037-4797-82a9-01a13d687421.png)


	Now add two secret, one is `NOTION_TOKEN`, which is the Notion Integration token we just keep.


	![image.png](/images/posts/40e79274-916c-4087-96f8-a568b62ce997.png)


	And another one is `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` which is the blog database id we just keep.

## Step 4: Deploy to Vercel


With your GitHub repository ready and secrets configured, it’s time to deploy your blog to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and go live with your Notion-powered blog!


After logging in, click **+ Add New Project**, then select your forked repo (e.g., `WuSandWitch-Blog`).

# Next Step


You can personalize your blog in config file, check [here](https://buroguru.zudo.cc/posts/config-guide-en).


# About Auto Updates


Once your blog is deployed, Buroguru will automatically sync content from your Notion database **every 12 hours** via GitHub Actions. The new posts will be published and redeployed without any manual steps.


If needed, you can also go to the **Actions tab in GitHub** and manually trigger the update workflow.
